# algos

This repository is designed as a study of various algorithms and getting to the bottom of them.
Detailed explanations are provided with meaning, various features, reasoning, and practicality.
You can use it to study, to explore, to enjoy, etc.

It's really just a DSA playground and handbook in one.

Most of the code is written in Rust, for maximum algorithm-pilling.
> However, Python examples are being planned for the future.

I try to provide detailed documentation on the explained structures and algorithms.
