# algos

This repository is designed as a study of various algorithms and getting to the bottom of them.
Detailed explanations are provided with meaning, features, reasoning, optimizations, and practicality.
You can use the project to study, to explore, to enjoy, etc.

It's really just a DSA playground and handbook in one.

Most of the code is written in Rustâ€”for maximum immersion and algorithm-pilling.
> However, Python (and potentially C++) examples are being planned for the future.

I try to provide detailed documentation on the presented structures and algorithms.
